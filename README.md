> **A-Agent** — An AI-powered workspace system for creation

## Project Overview

**namenotfound.ai** This system is a local-first AI system designed to build elements. 
For instance instead of saying "Build a pitch deck" This system would build an app that builds pitch decks. 
You act as a owner, build chain flows and roles. The underlying model engines can be swapped, you can use your own or an api. 
This system can run locally on any hardware however the hardware does determine how long a chain can be and the needed adjustments to the models.
Chains and orgs can be saved and shared so you can share anything you wish, additionally everything is as private and on device as you want it to be!
